# DynamicBoxer

The way [ISBoxer](http://isboxer.com/wiki/WoW:Quicker_Start_Guide) works currently is you need to 
create a new team for each and every combination of characters you may be multi-boxing with

This addon allows you to create only 1 team per layout and dynamically load any characters you wish into it

Likewise it lets you create new characters and teams without having to go back to isboxer suite and export to innerspace

This is quite important for instance in classic when you can't create your teams ahead of time and want to get going asap 
with your teams
