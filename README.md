# DynamicBoxer

The way [ISBoxer](http://isboxer.com/wiki/WoW:Quicker_Start_Guide) works currently is you need to go back outside of the game into the windows isboxer suite program each time you want to create a new character or change whichever combination of characters you may want to be multi-boxing with at the time.

This addon allows you to create only 1 team per layout and dynamically load any characters you wish into it

Likewise it lets you create new characters and teams dynamically without having to go back to isboxer suite, make changes there and export to innerspace

This is quite important for instance in classic when you can't create your teams ahead of time and want to get going asap with your teams
