ChangeLog for DynamicBoxer by MooreaTv (moorea@ymail.com)

1.4.0 MMM DD 2019 - WIP
    - WIP. Integrated MoLib's LRU for keeping last N masters
    - Cross realm support: Revamped communication/sync to allow for cross realm boxing (message the slot1/master).
Coming next:
    - Simple status UI

1.3.0 June 22nd 2019
    - adding `/dbox show` to show the current master token (Issue #16)
    - adding `/dbox reset` to clear all saved variables (start from scratch) this has similar effect to prexisting /dbox init but
        allows to completely clear all state (follow with /reload for it to take effect)
    - removed `/dbox channel` and `/dbox secret` as the token is now handled through ui; adding `/dbox set` to 
        set token string from the command line instead of the UI (but /dbox show/init is better)
    - Master automatically enables "show token" (/dbox show) when it detects a change in team, 
        so you can add members/copy existing token. Issue #17.
        And it automatically closes it once the team is complete !
        (broadcast the existing since 1.0 `/dbox init` if you want to change tokens across windows instead of reuse the last one)
    - Fixed #18 (bug with extra GetParent():Hide() causing master cancel button to hide UI)


1.2.0 June 18th 2019
    - Revamped simpler yet better and safer setup UI. One time setup is now only 3 broadcasted keystrokes:
         Ctrl-C , Ctrl-V , Return  (copy, paste, enter; that's it !)
    - Fixed potential issue (as previously cross realm wasn't working anyway) issue with name-realm search and replace
        now using MoLib's ReplaceAll which properly escapes all lua gsub characters for literal search and replace.

1.1.2 June 17th 2019
    - Fix issue #10 to allow original isboxer characters to be substring of one another, as well as new team characters
        (normalizes team in 2 passes)
    - Also address another TODO to remove unnecessary realm when same as self, earlier

1.1.1 June 13th 2019
    - Avoid rejoining the same channel right away while doing /dbox init setup UI (needed to clear a few more state)

1.1.0 June 13th 2019
    - Added optional id/password generator, you can tab between the 2 copy/paste etc (can be used for channel
    but mostly for the secret, it must be pasted on all windows, if copied, `/dbox random` to get just this utility)
    (Issue #8) with lots of work/learning to get a cool fixed width narrow display and handle tab, escape, click, select,
    typing etc as one may expect.
    - Handle trial accounts where BattleNet info is nil (Issue #7)
        as part of fix prefix provided channel name with DynamicBoxer4, if left empty (but don't) uses "demo"
    - Static dialogs are reusing widgets without reinitializing them (!) so changes made in UI config
     need to be reverted on OnHide (like clearing password field)
    - make sure we leave previous channel when doing "/dbox init"
    - fix bug on macro rewrite when missing slots (lua ipairs stops at first hole)

1.0.0 June 11th 2019 - ***1.0*** After 6 alpha/beta releases
    - Added UI (2 step dialog boxes, ran only once per account) to set channel/secret pair (Issue #2)
    - Also re runnable using `/dbox init` later
    - Limit maximum number of times we'll try sending/syncing (to 20 times/20s after channel join or /dbox m command)
    - DynBoxer.enabled boolean to turn off dynboxer even if loaded/running (used when user cancels out of the setup UI)
    - Luacheck'ed and some reformatting to 120 columns
    - Ensure `/dbox j` always sends the sync message
    - With all the above and testing showing things working, we are I believe feature complete for 1.0 and out of prototype mode!

0.1.5 June 10th 2019
    - Fix for lua error when not running in multiboxing setup (Issue #3)
    - Fix duplicate join event/messages
    - Debug output now has multiple verbosity level, use /dbox debug 9 for most verbose (new MoLib support for it)
    - Cleanup retries
    - Handle message send failure

0.1.4 June 10th 2019
    - Fix /reload on one character needing to rebroadcast from others (Issue #1)
    - Better color scheme
    - Only show isboxer warnings about bindings the first time
    - Split into 3 files for clarity and keeping ISBoxer code changes in one place
    - Refactor hooking to be cleaner and more generic and not conflict with our own functions
    - Globe lint fixes

0.1.3 June 7th 2019
    - Auto resync on channel join

0.1.2 June 7th 2019
    - First working version !! (and loads correctly along ISBoxer as independent addon)
    - Support for saved variables
    - Fix for ISBoxer loading bindings too early (when realm name isn't yet available), unregister its UPDATE_BINDINGS
    - updated /dbox help and commands
    - patches to isboxer.SetMacro so it can be ran more than once
    - need to use short name without realm when realm is same (!)

0.1.1 June 7th 2019
    - Same as 0.1.0 without the logo in the addon zip

0.1.0 June 7th 2019
    - Initial build as separate addon
