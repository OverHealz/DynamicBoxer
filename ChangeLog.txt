ChangeLog for DynamicBoxer by MooreaTv (moorea@ymail.com)

1.0.1 June 12th 2019
    - Added optional id/password generator, you can tab between the 2 copy/paste etc (can be used for channel
    but mostly for the secret, it must be pasted on all windows, if copied, `/dbox random` to get just this utility)
    - Handle trial accounts where BattleNet info is nil (Issue #7)
        as part of fix prefix provided channel name with DynamicBoxer4, if left empty (but don't) uses "demo"
    - Static dialogs are reusing widgets without reinitializing them (!) so changes made in UI config
     need to be reverted on OnHide (like clearing password field)

1.0.0 June 11th 2019 - 1.0 After 6 alpha/beta releases
    - Added UI (2 step dialog boxes, ran only once per account) to set channel/secret pair (Issue #2)
    - Also re runnable using `/dbox init` later
    - Limit maximum number of times we'll try sending/syncing (to 20 times/20s after channel join or /dbox m command)
    - DynBoxer.enabled boolean to turn off dynboxer even if loaded/running (used when user cancels out of the setup UI)
    - Luacheck'ed and some reformatting to 120 columns
    - Ensure `/dbox j` always sends the sync message
    - With all the above and testing showing things working, we are I believe feature complete for 1.0 and out of prototype mode!

0.1.5 June 10th 2019
    - Fix for lua error when not running in multiboxing setup (Issue #3)
    - Fix duplicate join event/messages
    - Debug output now has multiple verbosity level, use /dbox debug 9 for most verbose (new MoLib support for it)
    - Cleanup retries
    - Handle message send failure

0.1.4 June 10th 2019
    - Fix /reload on one character needing to rebroadcast from others (Issue #1)
    - Better color scheme
    - Only show isboxer warnings about bindings the first time
    - Split into 3 files for clarity and keeping ISBoxer code changes in one place
    - Refactor hooking to be cleaner and more generic and not conflict with our own functions
    - Globe lint fixes

0.1.3 June 7th 2019
    - Auto resync on channel join

0.1.2 June 7th 2019
    - First working version !! (and loads correctly along ISBoxer as independant addon)
    - Support for saved variables
    - Fix for ISBoxer loading bindings too early (when realm name isn't yet available), unregister its UPDATE_BINDINGS
    - updated /dbox help and commands
    - patches to isboxer.SetMacro so it can be ran more than once
    - need to use short name without realm when realm is same (!)

0.1.1 June 7th 2019
    - Same as 0.1.0 without the logo in the addon zip
